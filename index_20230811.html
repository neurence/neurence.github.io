        <h2>Denoiser Fine-Tuning</h2>

        <p>Experiments to train the demucs denoiser network to improve it as an input to the transformer autoencoder have been unsuccessful so far. The experiments are tending to overamplify and introduce artifacts into the denoised outputs, which is hindering the autoencoder outputs.</p>

        <p>A couple of experiments using combinations of losses that are showing a very slow loss descent have been left running in the background. The latest checkpoint outputs from these are increasing in 'speech-like' sounds from previous epochs, but are still unintelligible.</p>

        <h2>Low-latency Streaming Implementation</h2>

        <p>We're working on latency/receptive field issues that arise from streaming.</p>
        <p>The main issues identified are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>"Clicks" at block boundaries;</li>
            <li>High Latency/non causality;</li>

        </ol>
        <h3>1. Click removal:</h3>
        <p>We've identified the clicks as an artefact of the decoder network (HifiGAN).  Output audio cannot simply be concatenated when the frame length is short.</p>
        <p>We've been experimenting with using windowed overlapped frames to remove the clicks.</p>
        <p>Using a simple audio->mel encoder feeding a decoder retrained on mel features (as opposed to transformer output) here are the results:</p>
        <table>
            <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Frame Size 1024, no window</th>
                <th>Frame Size 1024, windowed</th>
                <th>Frame Size 2048, windowed</th>
            </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td><audio controls src="media/streaming/no_window.wav"></audio></td>
                <td><audio controls src="media/streaming/windowed1024.wav"></audio></td>
                <td><audio controls src="media/streaming/windowed2048.wav"></audio></td>
            </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>Although this improves the clicks, this is an not ideal solution, and increases latency.</p>
        <p>We've begun work on a low-latency modification to the HifiGAN decoder based on <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.07288.pdf">this paper</a>, (see below, 2) which should allow "seamless" joining of decoder output blocks, and also remove most of the latency.</p>
        <h3>2. Latency Reduction</h3>
        <p>In general, the solution to high-latency in streaming audio neural networks is to cache previous input-layer and hidden-layer outputs.  In the case of the encoder network, this requires a refactoring of the Transformer network. We'll be basing our work on based on <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.13451.pdf">This paper from Dolby Labs</a>.</p>
        <p>The decoder is simpler, and can be adapted.
            In essence this requires pre-padding the inputs to every convolution with cached values from previous steps.</p>
        <p>Implementing the decoder's convolution caches is the focus for next week. (Once we've calculated all the cache sizes, we'll be able determine the theoretical minimum latency value for the decoder network). </p>
