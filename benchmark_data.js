i wouldn't, i don't envy him much. do you tell him, it's a state of mind, it's a way of life. my three ventures into south london, i always had this perception of south london, particularly south west london, you know, windhamton and cases like that, being relatively okay. but when i was coming back from wimbledon in the summer, and the young man i stupidly decided to get a public bus, a very full public bus, to where merson abbey when we were staying and i think on like one or two, one or two points in time i genuinely thought we were gonna die on that bus. a bit dramatic perhaps but uh, yeah, it's been seriously, it's seriously grim. it's a bit like the question, i moved to peabrew. so six months, you just see all the stories you hear now, it's just like, it must have just been ignorant, it's a bit nice. it's a bit bizarre, isn't it? yeah, peterborough, described by griffith jones as an anonymous urban barnacle off the a1. it's such a shame because it's what cambridge is and the other city. and it's called cathedral and everything. it should be quite nice. why do i thought though about huntington? huntington on paper should be really nice. why do i thought though about huntington? huntington on paper should be really nice, isn't it? yes, because all he did was look at the tourist photos. yeah, and that's really nice. i mean, bin bear is just a concrete jungle with a historic creek in the middle. you know, it's probably a bit cool in the alps, but it's authentic. venture park. it's probably the school in the alphabit. it's a vintage. it's a vintage path. it's rode the best boat ever. yeah, but i think that used to, you know, be a county town where the whole shire named after it. it used to be the thing they were hunting in the shire. is that completely gone now? what is it now? technically, it was still district, but they keep changing it. so it did have st. ayrton now, but we're different, because st. ayrton is too big. two were st. ayrton and huntington's way, so it's huntington's and slythesden. then did the county disappear, was it in the 80s? i don't think so, yeah. then both the things. yeah. well, sussex wasn't very big. yeah. well, the two made a look at some other kind of vindon. bigger, and they hadn't been split up. but more sparsely protected, so... that's it. but then we got rutland. still there, but... that's it. that's it, don't... in mind,
